Applied Data Science with Python

Cleaned the dataset, handled missing values, and applied normalization to standardize sales and unit data.

Aggregated data using GroupBy() to analyze sales across states, demographic groups (Kids, Women, Men, Seniors), and time periods.

Performed descriptive statistical analysis including mean, median, mode, and standard deviation to understand trends and variability.

Generated daily, weekly, monthly, and quarterly sales reports to capture short-term and long-term performance.

Created a Seaborn-based dashboard with box plots, distribution plots, and time-of-day analysis for clear visualization of trends.

Enabled identification of peak periods, high- and low-performing segments, and overall trends to support strategic planning.

Integrated all steps in JupyterLab, combining data wrangling, analysis, and visualization into an actionable report for the Sales & Marketing team.
