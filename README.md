Applied Data Science with Python

The Sales Analysis Project provides a comprehensive view of sales performance to support decision-making by the Head of Sales & Marketing. 
The dataset was cleaned, missing values were handled, and normalization was applied to standardize sales and unit data.
Aggregations were performed using GroupBy() to analyze sales across states, demographic groups (Kids, Women, Men, Seniors), and time periods.
Descriptive statistics, including mean, median, mode, and standard deviation, were computed, and daily, weekly, monthly, and quarterly trends were generated.
A Seaborn-based dashboard was created with clear visualizations, including box plots, distribution plots, and time-of-day analysis, enabling the identification of peak periods, high- and low-performing segments, and long-term trends. 
The entire workflow, implemented in JupyterLab, combines data wrangling, analysis, and visualization into an integrated, actionable report for strategic planning and decision-making.
